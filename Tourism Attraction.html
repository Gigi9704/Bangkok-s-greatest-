    <p><img src="art-in-paradise-chiang-mai-1.jpg" width="300" height="200" title="Art in paradise"> <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3930280.127291192!2d97.32806578720053!3d15.84796568587995!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3102bdfe2de3acc5%3A0x76b78a551b17b09f!2sArt%20In%20Paradise%20Pattaya!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sza!4v1692632200998!5m2!1sen!2sza" width="300" height="200" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe> <img src="AIP.JPG" width="300" height="200"> <img src="venue.jpg" width="300" height="200"></p>
    
    <p>As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, "Art In Paradise" refers to a chain of illusional art museums that offer interactive and immersive <br>experiences through their exhibits. The concept of illusional art museums involves creating three-dimensional paintings, murals, and installations <br>that play with perspective, depth, and optical illusions. Visitors can step into these artworks, pose creatively, and take photos <br>that make it appear as though they are part of the scenes depicted in the paintings.

        "Art In Paradise" is one such illusional <br>art museum franchise that originated in Thailand. The first museum under this brand opened in Pattaya,<br> Thailand, in 2012. It gained popularity for its unique approach to art, allowing visitors to <br>become active participants in the artworks rather than just passive observers.</p>

<p>The museum typically features a variety of themed rooms, each with its own set of illusional artworks. These rooms can cover<br> a range of themes, such as underwater scenes, famous landmarks, fantasy landscapes, and more. Visitors<br> are encouraged to interact with the exhibits by striking creative poses, taking photos from specific angles, and engaging<br> with the optical illusions present in the artwork.

Keep in mind that my information might be outdated as of 2021,<br> so I recommend checking more recent sources to get the latest information on <br>"Art In Paradise" and any developments that might have occurred since then.</p><br>
