    <h2><bold> Festivals</bold></h2>
    
    <p>Bangkok is known for its vibrant and colorful festivals that showcase the country's rich cultural heritage.<br> Here are some of the popular festivals celebrated in Bangkok:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <p>
    <strong>Songkran Festival</strong><br />
        Songkran, also known as the Thai New Year, is one of the most famous festivals in Thailand. 
        It usually takes place in<br> mid-April and involves water-related festivities, where people engage in water fights <br>to symbolize washing away bad luck and starting anew. In Bangkok, the streets are transformed<br> into water battlegrounds, and locals and tourists alike participate in the fun.
        
        </p>
        <p>
    <strong>International Festival of Lights and Sound in Ayutthaya:</strong><br />
         While not in Bangkok itself, this festival held in nearby Ayutthaya, the ancient capital of Thailand,<br> is worth mentioning. It usually takes place in December and features light and sound<br> shows that highlight the historical and cultural significance of the area.
        
        </p>
    <strong>Loi Krathong Festival</strong><br />
         Loi Krathong is the Festival of Lights and typically falls in November. During this festival, people release small, beautifully decorated<br> boats made of banana leaves, flowers, and candles onto rivers and water bodies as a way to pay respect<br> to the water spirits and to let go of negative energy.
        
        </p>
     <strong>Bangkok International Festival of Dance and Music</strong><br />
         This annual cultural event, usually held between September and October, features international performances <br>in dance, music, opera, and theater. It's a showcase of various artistic genres and <br>draws both local and international talent.
        
        </p>
<strong>Asalha Puja and Khao Phansa</strong><br />
         Asalha Puja marks the Buddha's first sermon, and Khao Phansa marks the beginning of the Buddhist Lent, a period <br>of meditation and reflection for monks. These festivals usually fall in July and are observed with temple visits, <br>candlelit processions, and merit-making.

    <h2>Parks And Recreation</h2>
    
<h3><bold>Lumphini Park</bold></h3>
<p>Lumphini Park is Bangkok's most popular and oldest park. Lumphini is one of the few green spaces in this congested city.<br> Restaurants and bars line the north side of the park, and, although not legal within city limits, elephant trainers often<br> bring their elephants into the park and offer tourists rides for a modest fee.

<h3><bold>Samphran Elephant Grounds & Zoo</bold></h3>
    <p>Located on the outskirts of Bangkok, this is the best place in Thailand to see elephants.<br> Shows reenact eighteenth-century Thai battles, with the elephants clad in armor.<br> Elephants also perform in a circus and in polo matches.</p>
    
  <h3><bold>Massage</bold></h3>
    <img src="massage.jpeg" width="299" height="165">
<p>Massage is one of Bangkok's most popular pastimes. In Thailand, and much of Asia, massage is considered a component<br> of good health. Massage schools and businesses can be found all over the city.</p>

    <h2><bold>Libraries And Museums</bold></h2>
<h3><bold>The National Museum</bold></h3>
<p>The National Museum is considered to be Southeast Asia's largest and most comprehensive museum. Founded in 1782, the museum's<br> several buildings house artifacts representing more than 10,000 years of history. The museum gives visitors a thorough <br>overview of Thai history and culture.</p>

<h3><bold>The Grand Palace</bold></h3>
<p>The Grand Palace was founded in 1782 when Bangkok was made the nation's capital. It is still surrounded by high white walls that <br>were originally used for protection. This is Thailand's most frequented tourist site. The Palace consists<br> of more than 100 elaborately decorated buildings. Within the Palace grounds is the Wat <br>Phra Kaeo temple, considered one of the most beautiful temples in Thailand.</p>

<h3><bold>National Theatre</bold></h3>
<p>Thailand's National Theatre is located on Na Phra Lan Road next to the National Museum. Thai Classical dramas and other types of <br>international arts are periodically staged here. Current programs can be checked at the theatre on<br> weekdays between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm. Special exhibition shows of Thai classical dancing<br> and music are held on the last Friday and Saturday of each month.</p>

<h3><bold>National Art Gallery</bold></h3>
<p>Bangkok has a small but very vibrant contemporary art scene. Since most of the city's small private <br>or commercial galleries promote Thai and regional artists, a day of gallery-hopping is <br>a great way of experiencing the local arts scene.</p> 
    
<p>This gallery exhibits both modern and traditional Thai art, and it also schedules rotating and traveling exhibitions.<br> The gallery's collections range from traditional Thai art to the Western-influenced <br>portraiture of the 19th century and modern and contemporary works</p>
    
<p>Youâ€™ll soon discover that the city's art galleries and museums are pretty much scattered all over town, with several <br>large art complexes in the city centre offering an all-integrated art experience. If you<br> would like to immerse yourself in Bangkok's contemporary art scene, plan <br>ahead by checking out our list of great art galleries in Bangkok.</p>
