    <p>Bangkok is the most populous city in Thailand, with a population of an estimated 10.72 million. Bangkok is Thailand’s cultural and commercial <br>core, in addition to being the nation’s capital and most populated city. It is also the country’s principal port and the only metropolitan<br> area in a nation of rural towns and villages. Called Krung Thep by locals, Bangkok occupies around 1,568 square<br> kilometers (606 sq mi). The city became the capital of Thailand in 1782 and holds one of the world’s weirdest <br>records – the longest name of any place ever recorded. It also holds the record for <br>being one of the most visited cities by tourists in the world.</p>

<p>The city is the perfect spot for tourists for a number of reasons. Over 22 million foreign tourists visit Bangkok each year <br>due to the city’s sights, activities, and lifestyle that apply to multiple tourist groups. The city has been the<br> capital of Thailand for over two centuries and is home to many palaces. Some of them are still used <br>by the royal family, while others are open to the public. Tourists interested in the history of the city<br> and Thailand at large could easily visit one of these palaces or any of the numerous palaces<br> that have been converted into museums and academic or government buildings.</p>
