    Starting from the late 1700s, Bangkok emerged as Thailand's largest and most significant urban center. Following the devastating 1767 invasion by the Burmese,<br> which resulted in the destruction of Ayutthaya, the historical capital of Siam (now Thailand), the decision was made to relocate the capital downstream<br> along the Chao Phraya River to Thon Buri or Old Bangkok, situated on the river's western bank. In 1782, King Rama I <br>(1737–1809; ruled 1782–1809) took the throne and opted to transfer the capital to a village <br>on the opposite side of the river.</p> 
<p>This strategic move was aimed at creating a natural barrier using the expansive Chao Phraya River to shield the capital from potential Burmese invasions,<br> which were frequent at that time. The village across the river predominantly consisted of Chinese traders and was called Bangkok, <br>a name that translates to "Village of Wild Plums."</p>

    Although European architectural styles left their mark on the city's architecture, it's intriguing to note that both Bangkok and the entirety of Siam <br>managed to avoid colonization by European nations. This can be attributed to their strong centralized governance,<br> which provided a level of security. Additionally, the competing interests of major<br> European powers like France and Britain played a role.</p>
<p>These powers viewed Siam as a politically neutral intermediary connecting Indochina (controlled by France) and India as well<br> as Burma (controlled by Britain). However, it's worth mentioning that despite maintaining their sovereignty, <br>there were territorial disputes with the French that led to <br>Siam ceding certain areas to the Western power.</p>

<h2>TOURISM HISTORY</h2>
<img src="budget.jpeg">

<p>Tourism in Thailand gained popularity among the US military during the Vietnam War. Despite facing an economic downturn caused by <br>the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, tourism continued to thrive, fueled by an economic boom in the 1980s.<br> Throughout these challenges, Bangkok has consistently maintained its status as <br>a vital hub for both tourism and commerce in Asia.</p>

<p>However, Bangkok and Thailand as a whole have encountered their share of issues. Over the past few decades, there have been several instances of <br>protests and coups. In 2014, the country's democratic system was replaced with a "National Harmony" approach, effectively leading to a military<br> dictatorship. This transition has been accompanied by increasing limitations on freedom of expression and <br>assembly,and any form of disrespect towards the monarchy is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>Bangkok is renowned for its diverse cuisine and lively nightlife, but its historical significance is perhaps its most prominent aspect.
    Throughout the city, <br>you'll find a scattering of historic edifices and temples. Among these, the Grand Palace stands out as one of Thailand's most crucial landmarks.<br> This remarkable complex dates all the way back to 1782, a period when King Rama I designated Bangkok as the new capital. <br>Notably, Bangkok boasts two other iconic temples: Wat Pho and Wat Traimitr.</p>

    <p>Within the Wat Pho temple, the Reclining Buddha stretches an impressive 35 meters (151 feet) in length. Meanwhile, the Wat Traimitr <br>temple proudly houses the world's largest solid-gold Buddha statue, weighing an impressive five metric tons (five-and-a-half tons) <br>and towering at three meters (ten feet) tall. Adding to the historical charm are the Royal Ceremonial Barges,<br> a much-admired attraction. These ornately adorned and intricately carved longboats take on the forms of <br>mythical creatures and are exclusively employed by the king during special occasions.</p>
